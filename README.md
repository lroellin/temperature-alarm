# temperature-alarm
Plays an alarm if the temperature falls below a threshold

You can set
* a temperature threshold
* a time threshold
* under or over that threshold? (one line of code)

After the temperature threshold has been exceeded, a timer is starting. If the timer goes over a certain interval, an alarm sound goes off. 

There's also a reset button that will reset the timer and extend the interval to suppress the alarm. The extension (multiplier) is also configurable.

# Wiring Diagram
Please don't stone me to death, it's my first electronics project and it works :) I'm not an expert on wiring or notation.
